# Mutation-Testing
Mutation testing is used to design new software tests and evaluate the quality of existing software tests.
<br>
Mutation testing involves modifying a program in small ways. 
<br>
Each mutated version is called a mutant and tests detect and reject mutants by causing the behavior of the original version to differ from the mutant
